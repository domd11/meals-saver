# Meal Saver

Meal Saver is my favorite project that I have done all year. I came up with the idea when I was looking for an API project to do. When I came across, MealDB, I was hooked on finding meals from around the world. I felt it was great for those who like trying new foods. As I was building the website, more ideas kept coming up, and to this day, I am thinking of ways to optimize the website. Even though it is not perfect, I learned a lot. This was my first project using Firebase, and although it was rough at first, when I understood the basics and read the documentation it became fun. I used Firebase and NextJS for this website. I struggled a bit accessing the API, but I eventually got it and had a lot of fun using it. I used the MealDB and CocktailsDB API to get data about the drinks and foods. I then used React Icons for functions. I used Firebase to save the liked drinks and food to the user's account. 

Improvements: 
1. I want to remove the like button from cocktails and food 
2. I want to add a comment feature
